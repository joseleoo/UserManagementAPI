# UserManagementAPI

## Copilot Assistance

Microsoft Copilot assisted in the following ways during the development of this API:

- **Generated complete CRUD controller code** for user management, including route attributes, action methods, and response types.
- **Suggested a simple in-memory data store** for demonstration and testing purposes.
- **Provided an example User model** for quick prototyping.
- **Ensured RESTful conventions** by using appropriate status codes (`200 OK`, `201 Created`, `204 No Content`, `404 Not Found`) and methods like `CreatedAtAction`.
- **Improved code readability and maintainability** by following best practices for ASP.NET Core Web API controllers.
